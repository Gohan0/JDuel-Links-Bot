# JDuel Links Bot

This is an ultimate all-in-one modding tool and farming bot for the [**`Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links` Steam version**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601510/YuGiOh_Duel_Links) trying to fulfill all of your modding and botting needs. This bot's cheats can also be used on the [Japanese Yahoo client](https://games.yahoo.co.jp/yugioh/duel_links) but not all features (especially the bot aspect) will work.

*Also feel free to check out our work for [Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449850/YuGiOh_Master_Duel) here: [JMaster-Duel-Bot](../../../JMaster-Duel-Bot).*

## Operating System Support

* Windows 7 64-Bit
* Windows 8/8.1 64-Bit
* Windows 10 64-Bit
* Windows 11 64-Bit

**Note:**
Other operating systems and 32-bit operating systems are not supported, notably Mac OS X, Android, iOS or all other Desktop flavors of Linux.

**Technical reasoning:**
The bot heavily relies on the Windows API and memory hacking is usually a very operating system specific task which cannot be abstracted away easily. The memory addresses, architecture and game executable layout might drastically differ as well due to different compilers etc. for non-Windows platforms which make generic code supporting different operating systems yet another nearly impossible task.

Furthermore, you cannot make a bot or cheats the same way on e.g. Android due to security restrictions. Even simple APK modding got harder to do on recent Android versions. Either way, you probably need a rooted phone to do anything advanced like this bot. Most people don't have a rooted phone (me included).

In conclusion, get or use a Windows PC to enjoy the full benefits of the bot. Every family should have one. Even if it's older, it should work fine for the most part.

## Runtime Requirements

For this bot you need to install `Java 8 64-bit` (or above). [Java 17](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.1_windows-x64_bin.exe) is recommended though.

Check the `README.txt` in the download archive for more information on how to set this tool up.
